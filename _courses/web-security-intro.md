## Course Overview

Welcome to **Introduction to Web Application Security**! This comprehensive course will teach you the essential skills needed to identify, exploit, and prevent common web application vulnerabilities.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks
- Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in a controlled environment
- Implement security controls to prevent attacks
- Conduct basic security assessments of web applications
- Apply security best practices in development

### Course Format

This course combines:

- **Video Lectures**: Weekly video content explaining concepts and demonstrations
- **Hands-on Labs**: Practice exploiting and fixing vulnerabilities in a safe environment
- **Reading Materials**: Security guides, research papers, and documentation
- **Weekly Assignments**: Practical exercises to reinforce learning
- **Final Project**: Comprehensive security assessment of a sample application

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with HTTP protocol
- Basic command-line skills
- A GitHub account for submissions

### Tools & Environment

We'll use several tools throughout the course:

- **OWASP WebGoat**: Interactive learning environment
- **Burp Suite Community Edition**: Web vulnerability scanner
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For inspecting web traffic
- **Docker**: For running vulnerable applications safely

### Assessment

Your progress will be evaluated through:

- Weekly lab assignments (50%)
- Participation in discussions (10%)
- Midterm security assessment (15%)
- Final project (25%)

### Getting Started

1. Enroll in the course through the enrollment page
2. Join the course GitHub repository
3. Set up your development environment
4. Complete the Week 1 pre-assessment

### Community & Support

- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions and help fellow students
- **Weekly Office Hours**: Live Q&A sessions with the instructor
- **Study Groups**: Connect with other learners
- **Slack Channel**: Real-time communication with the community

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Web Security Fundamentals

Introduction to web application security, the CIA triad, and threat modeling. We'll explore the OWASP Top 10 and set up our lab environment.

**Lab**: Setting up OWASP WebGoat and completing initial challenges

### Week 2: Injection Attacks

Learn about SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection vulnerabilities. Understand how attackers exploit these flaws and how to prevent them.

**Lab**: Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and implementing parameterized queries

### Week 3: Authentication & Session Management

Explore secure authentication mechanisms, password storage, and session management. Learn about common authentication vulnerabilities.

**Lab**: Breaking weak authentication and implementing secure authentication

### Week 4: Access Control & Authorization

Understand authorization flaws, privilege escalation, and how to implement secure access control.

**Lab**: Exploiting broken access control and implementing RBAC

### Week 5: Security Configuration & Data Protection

Learn about security misconfiguration, sensitive data exposure, and encryption best practices.

**Lab**: Identifying misconfigurations and implementing data protection measures

### Week 6: Final Project

Apply everything you've learned in a comprehensive security assessment project.

**Project**: Perform a security assessment of a sample web application and submit a detailed report
